## PROBLEM STATEMENT
##### 1. Lack of genuine reviews of tourist attractions :
Fake reviews is a major problem when it comes to tourism. People who love to explore new boundaries do not have a trust worthy community which can help them. The biggest problem we have with review applications that we have today is that there is no way to check the genuine nature of a review and people can also post reviews even without actually visiting that place. This leads to a very small group of trustworthy reviews we receive from our friends and family.
##### 2. Large possibility of getting lost while exploring new destinations :
Many people tend to drift away from their path while travelling and end up being lost in unacquainted places and find it difficult to find their way back to a safe and known place which sometimes can lead to unfortunate events.

## PROPOSED SOLUTION (Part 1)
The solution for the problem we have in hand can not be solved by just creating an application, itâ€™s more about creating a community of like minded people who love to travel and explore beyond their range.
1. In our step towards building this community a user can post photographs with captions of a place he/she travelled to share few memories he/she created which will get verified by the image processing we use in our application to maintain genuine nature of all the posts.
2. Another user who wants to visit a place can search for it and can find all the memories shared by the other users which can help him/her make decision regarding visiting that place. 
3. Users can also comment and like the memories of other users which will encourage users to share more memories which will enhance the engagement of the community.
4. It will also help in improving tourism at many remote places as people will get to know about places they had never heard of but are worth enough their time. 

## PROPOSED SOLUTION (Part 2)
Safety is a major concern when it comes to travelling and many people do get lost while exploring new boundaries.
1. Our application makes it easier to not get lost at unknown locations as a user can leave breadcrumbs on his/her way so that if they tend to lose their way they can trace their way back to a safe location and can also prevent bad things from happening.
2. To make it more interactive for the users will integrated augmented reality so than one can actually see the breadcrumbs they left through their mobile camera and also see the direction towards the nearest breadcrumb.

## RAJASTHAN EXCLUSIVE
The ship of desert be the speciality of Rajasthan and most of the tourist who visit Rajasthan want to ride a camel. So to make it possible we have created an feature which helps the user to book a camel ride as simple as a cab from the nearest location. 

## FUTURE PROSPECTS
##### 1. Augmented Reality :
In the next few versions we would be able to use augmented reality in a way advanced way from which the user would be able to scan monuments and posters to get the history through text or video formats.
##### 2. Image Processing and Spam Detection :
To keep the data in our application as genuine as possible we will use image detection which would detect the genuine photographs and would also scrap out the spam reviews and memories.
